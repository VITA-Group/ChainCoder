Vasya has a graph containing both directed (oriented) and undirected (non-oriented) edges. There can be multiple edges between a pair of vertices.

Vasya has picked a vertex s from the graph. Now Vasya wants to create two separate plans:

  to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to maximize number of vertices reachable from vertex s;  to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to minimize number of vertices reachable from vertex s. 

In each of two plans each undirected edge must become directed. For an edge chosen directions can differ in two plans.

Help Vasya find the plans.
